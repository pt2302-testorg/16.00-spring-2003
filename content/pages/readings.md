Interactive Aerospace Engineering and Design with CD-ROM
--------------------------------------------------------

Author: Dava Newman, Massachusetts Institute of Technology  
ISBN: 0-07-235124-1  
Description: ©2002 / Hardcover with CDROM   
Publication Date: July 2001

Overview
--------

Intended for both majors and non-majors taking a first course in Introduction to Aerospace Engineering or Introduction to Flight. This new text will inspire students with its integrated bound-in CD-ROM and its strong emphasis in design. Its active visual approach and inclusion of space-oriented engineering makes it ideal for the changing needs of the Aerospace Engineering field. Newman's book is the first to include integrated multimedia, strong coverage of space flight, the design process, and extensive coverage of space flight. A CD-ROM, bound in with the book, provides extensive animations, QuickTime movies, and MATLAB{{< sup "®" >}} based simulations to motivate student readers. A student design project is included to convey the importance of team orientated design in an accessible manner. All resource and multimedia materials are provided on the CD-ROM, including: PDF files of the book chapters; additional color photographs, figures, and pictures referenced in the text; multimedia animations, simulations, and vrml files. The icons in the book, namely, the CD-ROM and World Wide Web (WWW) icons, refer you to materials that are on the CD-ROM and website, respectively, not in the text. In the margins of the text you will see the CD-ROM icon with a filename, which means that the referenced resource material (photograph, animation, simulation, etc.) is linked to the CD-ROM and should be accessed and studied at that point in the chapter. The lighter-than-air (LTA) vehicle and electronics laboratory ('Ornithopter Lab') contain extensive multimedia materials and are referenced throughout the book, especially in Chapter 12. The WWW icon refers to the website for the text and CD-ROM where one will find a chronological listing of all the URLs referenced throughout the book.

Features
--------

*   With a growing trend toward inclusion of design in engineering courses, Newman's book includes a hands on comprehensive design project for students, as well as topical coverage of design issues where appropriate.
*   The book is packaged with a CD-ROM containing a web based format of active animations, simulations, and QuickTime movies.
*   While many books lack coverage of space applications, Newman's book provides the best balance of conceptual foundations, aircraft and aerospace.
*   Book will also include an accompanying Web Site with both instructor and student resources.
*   Very current.
