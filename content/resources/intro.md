description: Delta Design is a team exercise developed at M.I.T. by Prof. Louis Bucciarelli
  for engineering education at any level - undergraduate, graduate, or professional.
  Players are assigned one of four roles and form teams to design a new residence
  suitable for inhabitants of the imaginary Deltoid plane. The design is assembled
  on a game board by placing triangular red- and blue- colored tiles on a diamond-shaped
  grid. Each role has its own requirements for the number and placement of tiles,
  so that the team must make tradeoffs in order to achieve individual and group performance
  goals within the three or four hours required for learning and playing the game.
